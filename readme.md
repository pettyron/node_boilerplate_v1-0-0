# NodeJS Back-End Framework Boilerplate

This framework boilerplate requires NodeJS greater than 7.6.x.

A complete list of available package dependencies via NPM is located in the package_dependencies.md file.

The best use of this set-up is for those projects that do not warrant or are not best suited for a client-side templating engine. Although this framework can easily adapt for use with Angular, React or Vue.

_TODO_: Put in the testing framework. Not sure if this will be Jasmine or Mocha at the moment (with Karma).
